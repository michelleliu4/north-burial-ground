# North Burial Ground

A data visualization project developed for DATA 1500 (Data Visualization) at Brown University, in collaboration with the [Community-Engaged Data & Evaluation Collaborative (CEDEC)](https://swearer.brown.edu/faculty-staff/data-and-evaluation-partnerships). This project explores the **North Burial Ground**, a centuries-old active cemetery in Providence, Rhode Island.

## Project Overview
Historian **John E. Sterling** and volunteers surveyed the cemetery’s Old Section, documenting tombstone conditions. This project analyzes trends in composition to inform preservation. It uses R and Python for data processing and visualization, with final charts polished in Adobe Illustrator. It is presented as an article, available [here](https://michelleliu4.github.io/north-burial-ground/).

## Dataset
- **Primary dataset**: Survey of tombstones conducted by Sterling’s team (1994–2000), provided by the [North Burial Ground](https://www.providenceri.gov/parks/north-burial-ground/)
- **Additional data**: Newer survey data from [Jordi Rivera](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jriver43) (not included in final visuals)
